# solved_programming_elixir

Here are my solutions for exercises from an amazing book called
["Programming Elixir"](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir)
by [Dave Thomas](https://github.com/pragdave).

I'm using [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)
suggestions here.

The folders contain exercises for each chapter with tasks to be done.

Most of exercises have ExUnit tests. Just run script via `elixir example_script.exs` to see results.
